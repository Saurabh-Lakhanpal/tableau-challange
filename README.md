# Citi Bike Trip Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aggregates data from the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to uncover two unexpected phenomena. By analyzing the data, designing visualizations, and creating dashboards, we aim to provide insights for city officials to improve New York City's bike-sharing program. The findings will be presented in a Tableau story, including static or dynamic maps as specified.

## Objectives
1. Identify **two unexpected phenomena** from the Citi Bike Trip data.
2. Design **2–5 visualizations** for each phenomenon (4–10 in total).
3. Develop **dashboards** to present findings logically and visually.
4. Create maps to visualize station popularity and trends.
5. Deliver a professional and user-friendly presentation for city officials.

## Dataset
The Citi Bike Trip History Logs provide monthly trip data. For this project:
- Select 1–3 files to avoid performance issues and ensure consistency.
- Focus on data within a **relevant timespan**, ideally from recent years.

## Key Questions to Explore
- Total number of trips during the selected period.
- Percentage growth in total ridership.
- Changes in proportions of short-term customers vs. annual subscribers.
- Peak hours of usage during summer and winter months.
- Identification of the top and bottom 10 stations for starting and ending journeys.
- Analysis of trip duration by user type.
- Average distance of bike trips.
- Identification of bikes (by ID) likely due for repair or inspection.
- Variability in bike utilization.

## Deliverables
### Visualizations
- **4–10 visualizations** designed to highlight phenomena and trends.
- **2 dashboards** for detailed exploration of phenomena.

### Maps
- **Option 1 (Basic):** A static map with station popularity indicators and zip code overlays.
- **Option 2 (Advanced):** A dynamic map showing changes in station popularity over time.

### Final Presentation
- A Tableau story incorporating:
  - Phenomenon visualizations.
  - Dashboards.
  - City official maps.
- **Markdown analysis file** describing findings, trends, and notable patterns.

## Methodology
1. **Data Aggregation:**
   - Merge and clean data from selected history log files.
   - Ensure data consistency and remove errors or outliers.

2. **Phenomena Identification:**
   - Analyze the data creatively to uncover unexpected insights.
   - Utilize socioeconomic or geographic data for deeper understanding.

3. **Visualization Design:**
   - Use color schemes and labels matching the Citi Bike visual style.
   - Develop interactive dashboards for user exploration.

4. **Mapping Trends:**
   - Use Tableau's map layer feature to visualize station popularity and trends.

5. **Presentation & Analysis:**
   - Provide a concise write-up of findings, backed by specific visualizations.
   - Tailor the analysis for non-technical audiences (e.g., city officials).

## Considerations
- **Data Selection:** Use the most recent data for relevance.
- **Technical Challenges:** Clean and format data meticulously.
- **Audience:** Visualizations should be colorful and easy to interpret.
- **Performance:** Work with small extracts initially to prevent performance issues.
